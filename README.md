This app uses the edamam api to allow users to search for recipes from a database. The user can also add their favorite recipes.

Technologies I used here: React, Redux, React-Router, create-react-app, styled-components.

Although Redux was unnecessary for this simple application, I used it here just for the purpose of learning the API.
